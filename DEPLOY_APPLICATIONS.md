# How to connect your application to the LACChain network

This guide aims to give you an overview of some mainstream tools that you can use to deploy Smart Contracts, connect external applications and broadcast transactions to the LACChain Besu Network.

## Truffle

Ethereum Smart Contracts are pieces of code that can be deployed to the LACChain Besu Network and will live there in perpetuity. Although there are many ways to deploy your smart contracts, we recommend the use of Truffle.

[Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview "Truffle Overview") is basically a development environment where you could easily develop smart contracts with itâ€™s built-in testing framework, smart contract compilation and deployment, interactive console, and many more features.

It's recommended for developers who want to build Javascript projects based on smart contracts (like Dapps). With Truffle you can have a better simulation of a real blockchain environment.

### Install

First, let's install truffle.

>`npm install -g truffle`

>`truffle version`

Now we can create our project folder, which we will name **MyDapp**.

>`mkdir MyDapp`

>`cd MyDapp`

With Truffle, you can create a bare project template, or use [Truffle Boxes](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/advanced/creating-a-truffle-box "Truffle Box Overview"), which are example applications and project templates. For this tutorial, we will start from scratch, so we execute the following command in our MyApp directory:

>`truffle init`

This command creates a bare Truffle project. After doing so, you should have the following files and folders:

* contracts/: Directory for Solidity contracts
* migrations/: Directory for scriptable deployment
* test/: Directory for test files for testing your application and contracts
* truffle-config.js: Truffle configuration file

### Contract Compilation

Before anything else, let's create a very simple smart contract named **MyContract.sol** and store it in the contracts folder. All smart contracts you create should be stored there.

Our smart contract will contain code that's as simple as this:

```js
    // We will be using Solidity version 0.5.12 
    pragma solidity 0.5.12;

    contract MyContract {
        string private message = "My First Smart Contract";

        function getMessage() public view returns(string memory) {
            return message;
        }

        function setMessage(string memory newMessage) public {
            message = newMessage;
        }
    }
```
Basically, our smart contract has a variable named `message`, which contains a little message that is initilized as `My First Smart Contract`. Also we have two functions that can set or get that variable `message`

To compile the smart contract, execute the command:

>`truffle compile`

### Contract Deployment

#### Prerequisites

First, we need to install the [truffle hdwallet-provider](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/hdwallet-provider) according to [Using Hyperledger Besu with Truffle](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/HowTo/Develop-Dapps/Truffle "Truffle with Besu") to be able to deploy contracts and send transactiones with truffle:

>`npm install -g @truffle/hdwallet-provider`

Now, we need to create a new file in the **migrations** directory. Then, create a new file named **2_deploy_contracts.js**, and write the following code:

```js
    var MyDapp = artifacts.require("MyContract");

    module.exports = function(deployer){
        deployer.deploy(MyDapp);
    };
```
Next, we need to edit the Truffle configuration (**truffle-config.js**).

To briefly describe the parts that make up the configuration:

* networks: Will hold the configuration of our Ethereum client where we will be deploying our contracts
* compilers: Will hold the configuration of Solc compiler

Type your private key, network address IP node and RPC port in the networks part:

```js
    const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");
    const privateKey = "<PRIVATE_KEY>";
    const privateKeyProvider = new HDWalletProvider(privateKey, "http://<ADDRESS_IP_NODE>:<PORT_RPC_NODE>");

    module.exports = {
        networks: {
            development: {
                host: "127.0.0.1",
                port: 7545,
                network_id: "*"
            },
            lacchain: {
                provider: privateKeyProvider,
                network_id: "648529",
                gasPrice: 0
            }
        }
    };
```
***NOTE: This is just an example. NEVER hard code production private keys in your code or commit them to git. They should always be loaded from environment variables or a secure secret management system.***

Truffle migrations are scripts that help us deploy our smart contract to the LACCHAIN network. Let's deploy it:

>`truffle migrate -network lacchain`

Finally you get the deployment report where you can see the address contract similar to this:

```json
